# Home Audio Sound Classification System

## Project Overview
The Home Audio project aims to develop a TinyML sound classification system capable of differentiating various sounds in a home environment. This system is designed to assist individuals, particularly the deaf community, by detecting ambient sounds such as doorbells, telephones, and alarms.

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to classify sounds with a minimum accuracy of 90%.
- Create an autonomous system that can train and improve itself with minimal intervention.
- Ensure scalability and efficiency in processing and memory usage.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains datasets and related documentation.
  - `README.md`: Information about the datasets used in the project.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
  - `01_exploration.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and visualization.

- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - `data_pipeline.py`: Functions for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
  - `model.py`: Defines the machine learning model architecture and training functions.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for logging, configuration, and performance evaluation.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
  - `test_model.py`: Tests for the model functions and classes.

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration file with project dependencies.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd homeaudio
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate homeaudio
   ```

3. Install additional dependencies if needed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for initial data exploration.
- Implement data preprocessing in `src/data_pipeline.py`.
- Define and train the machine learning model in `src/model.py`.
- Run unit tests in the `tests/` directory to ensure functionality.

## Continuous Communication
Regular updates and discussions will be held to monitor project progress and address any challenges encountered during development.
